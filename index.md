###### Amy Houseman is a final year Bsc (Hons) Genetics student at Edge Hill University, UK. 

###### Her interests include genomics and bioinformatics in relation to the diagnosis and pathogenicity of human genetic disease.
###### Amy completed a year working in the Big Data Biology Group at Fudan University, advised by Prof. Luis Pedro Coelho from September 2019 to June 2020. It was here that she completed two projects in the field of applied bioinformatics. One project involved identifying and classifying a cryptic Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) recovered from human gut metagenome data using [MACREL](https://macrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a tool created by her colleague CÃ©lio Dias Santos-Junior. Her final project involved curating a database showing the interaction between microbes in the human gut and psychotropic drugs. This database was in collaboration with The Hust group at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

###### Amy's final year dissertation project focuses on the creating of an R tool that will identify and model mutations from patients with Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis. After completion of this project, June 2021, Amy hopes to undertake a PhD in a field relating to human disease and genetics/genomics.
